CSS stands for Cascading Stylesheets. The cascade is the algorithm for solving conflicts where multiple CSS rules apply to an HTML element. It's the reason that the text of the button styled with the above CSS will be purple.

Understanding the cascade algorithm helps you understand how the browser resolves conflicts like this. The cascade algorithm has 4 distinct stages.

Position and order of appearance: the order in which your CSS rules appear
Specificity: an algorithm that determines which CSS selector has the strongest match
Origin: the order in which CSS appears and where it comes from, whether that is a browser style, CSS from a browser extension, or your authored CSS
Importance: some CSS rules are weighted more heavily than others, especially with the !important rule type
Lets look into all these one by one

Specificity Calculation
To calculate specificity, assign a value to each part of the selector:

Universal Selector: 0
Element selectors and pseudo-elements: 1
Class selectors, attribute selectors, and pseudo-classes: 10
ID selectors: 100
Inline styles: 1000
Then, add up the values of all the parts in the selector.


Quick Quiz
What will be the specificity value of the following selector:

a.harryclass.rohan-class[href]:hover {
  color: red;
}
Solution
To calculate the specificity value of the selector a.harryclass.rohan-class[href]:hover, you can break down its components:

Element selectors: a contributes 1 point.
Class selectors: .harryclass and .rohan-class each contributes 10 points, totaling 20 points.
Attribute selector: [href] contributes 10 points.
Pseudo-class: :hover adds another 10 points.
Add up all these values:

1 (element) + 20 (classes) + 10 (attribute) + 10 (pseudo-class) = 41.

So, the specificity value of the selector a.harryclass.rohan-class[href]:hover will be 41.
